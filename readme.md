# New Tender

An MS Batch script to help set up tender directories at the day job. I created something like this at my last job but lost the files when I moved on. I wish I'd put it on github back then.

## Instructions

1. Run the .bat file from the directory you want it located.
2. Give the project a name.
3. Give the project a number.
4. Have a cup of tea.
